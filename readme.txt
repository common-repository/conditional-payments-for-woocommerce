Restrict WooCommerce payment methods based on conditions. Works with your existing payment methods.

== Description ==
Conditional Payments for WooCommerce allows you to restrict payment methods based on conditions. For example, you can enable Cash on Delivery only when the shipping method is Local pickup.

The plugin works with your existing payment methods. You can restrict PayPal, Stripe, Cash on Delivery and any other payment method.

= Example 1 =

You have two payment methods, PayPal and Cash on Delivery. PayPal can be used for all orders but COD only when the customer pickups the order.

With Conditional Payments you can add shipping method condition to Cash on Delivery which checks that the shipping method is Local pickup.
